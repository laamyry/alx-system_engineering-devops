# Issue Summary:

Duration: November 1, 2023, 15:00 - November 2, 2023, 09:00 (UTC)
Impact: The user authentication service experienced a complete outage, affecting 80% of users who were unable to log in or access their accounts during the incident.
## Timeline:

Detection Time: November 1, 2023, 15:00 (UTC)

Detection Method: An automated monitoring alert indicated a spike in failed authentication attempts.

## Actions Taken:

Investigated the authentication service logs for anomalies.
Assumed a potential database issue and checked database performance metrics.
Misleadingly explored a network-related problem, inspecting firewalls and network configurations.
Escalated the incident to the system reliability team.
## Escalation:

The incident was initially handled by the development team.
Escalated to the system reliability team after database and network issues were ruled out.
## Resolution:

Identified an issue with the external identity provider causing intermittent failures.
Temporarily switched to a backup identity provider to restore service stability.
Implemented a hotfix to address the root cause in the external identity provider.
# Root Cause and Resolution:

## Root Cause:

The external identity provider's API experienced degraded performance due to a misconfiguration on their end.
Increased traffic during peak hours exacerbated the issue, leading to authentication failures.
## Resolution:

Collaborated with the external identity provider to correct the misconfiguration promptly.
Implemented rate limiting on authentication requests to mitigate the impact of increased traffic.
Enhanced monitoring to detect similar issues proactively.
# Corrective and Preventative Measures:

## Improvements/Fixes:

Conduct a thorough review of third-party service dependencies for potential misconfigurations.
Enhance monitoring alerts for early detection of authentication service anomalies.
Implement load testing to assess the system's resilience during peak usage.
## Tasks:

Patch the authentication service to support automatic failover to secondary identity providers.
Update incident response protocols to involve the system reliability team more efficiently.
Document the incident and resolution process for future reference and training.
